# JapaneseRandomTime
As I am learning Japanese and felt I needed to train, I created a little JS script to generate random date and time in Japanese language.
Here's how to:

Download the file JapaneseRandomTime.js
Put it in your chosen folder.
Open the terminal.
Run 'node JapaneseRandomTime.js'
Run again for a newly random generated date and time.
Et voilÃ .
